> **Hello, I’ll be honest with you: it’s very complicated to recreate this script because the site’s security has become much better; they added Cloudflare to the most important requests, an anti-debugger that blocks the site and sends another captcha when the browser console is open, they’re sending a captcha every 2 minutes and even blocked Burp Suite on the website, so yes, it’s really very difficult to recreate the script; honestly, I don’t know what else to do, I’ve run out of ideas and that’s it… if anyone has any ideas and wants to help with the code, feel free.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> <p><sub><strong>1.</strong> None of the scripts will work if you close the browser tab. You must keep the WPlace tab open, even if it's in the background.</sub></p>
> <p><sub><strong>2.</strong> Never run both scripts on the same page — this can bug your WPlace. If it happens, just refresh the page!</sub></p>
> <p><sub><strong>3.</strong> If the script doesn’t detect the available colors, just click the "Paint" button to show them — only then start the Auto-Imager.</sub></p>
